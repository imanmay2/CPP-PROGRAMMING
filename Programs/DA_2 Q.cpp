// 2. Gym Membership Management

// Design a program to manage gym memberships using arrays to store member details such as IDs, names, and membership statuses (Active or Inactive). The program should include the following functionalities:

// 1. Add new members to the system by providing their IDs and names. The membership status of newly added members should default to "Active."

// 2. Search for a member by their ID and display their details, including their name and membership status. If the member is not found, display an appropriate message.

// 3. Update the membership status of an existing member (e.g., mark as "Inactive").

// 4. Calculate and display the total number of active and inactive members.

// 5. Display the details of all members, including their IDs, names, and membership statuses.

// These operations should be implemented using functions, and a menu-driven interface should allow the user to manage gym memberships interactively

// Sample Input:

// Menu:

// 1. Add Member

// 2. Search Member

// 3. Update Membership Status

// 4. Calculate Membership Totals

// 5. Display All Members

// 0. Exit

// Member 102 (Bob) added successfully.

// ID: 101, Name: Alice, Status: Active


// Membership status of Member 102 updated to Inactive.


// Membership Totals:
