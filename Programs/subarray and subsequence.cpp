/*
SUBARRAY : CONTINUOUS PART OF THE ARRAY

no. of subarrays of an array with n elements = nC2 + n 
                                             = (n*(n+1))/2




SUNSEQUENCE : A SUBSEQUCNE IS A SEQUENCE THAT CAN BE DERIVED AN ARRAY BY SELECTING 
            ZERO OR MORE ELEMENTS, WITHOUT CHANGING THE ORDER OF THE REMAINING ELEMENTS.


no. of subsequence of an array with n elements = 2^n.



NOTE:  Every Subarray is a sequence but every subsequence is not a subarray.
